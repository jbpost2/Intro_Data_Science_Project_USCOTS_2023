# Purpose

Creating meaningful projects in a data science course can be a time consuming task. The purpose of this beyond session is to provide example project instructions from a graduate level introductory data science course using the tidyverse that could be used to create a similar assessment for your class along with example student submissions. The purpose of the project is to give students practice writing coherent R functions to query an API (think online database), return the data in a usable format, and summarize the data in a meaningful way. The project discussed here requires the topics of: R Markdown, Function Writing, Data Manipulation, and Summarizing Data. Students should be familiar with the common steps of conducting an exploratory data analysis in R.

# Project Requirements

- `r knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/main/SVG/rmarkdown.svg",)`
- `r icon_style(icons::academicons("osf"), scale = 2, fill = "#035AA6")`
- `r icons::fontawesome("github")` (optional) 
This is the `posterdown_betterland` template for the {posterdown} package! I was inspired by the twitter thread of [Mike Morrison](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041) and wanted to apply the `#betterposter` concept to the reproducible (yet simple to use) functionality of the {posterdown} package [@R-posterdown]. If you're not an R user don't sweat as you do **NOT** need to use it at all! Feel free to use only the Markdown functionality of this package :)

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

## Objectives

1. Pick a template layout.
2. Write/ create your poster content distraction free.
3. Let posterdown do its thing!


**_Now on to the results!_**

# Results

Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`, Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure).

```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"}
par(mar=c(2,2,0,1))
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width,
     col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width")
```

Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the `echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure \@ref(fig:myprettycode)!

```{r myprettycode, echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=3.5, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#008080", 
        border = "#0b4545",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:8,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
