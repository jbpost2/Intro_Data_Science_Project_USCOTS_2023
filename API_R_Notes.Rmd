## Goals

- Understand very basics of APIs 

- Contact an API using R

- Process returned data

## APIs

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) - a defined method for asking for information from a computer  

- [List of APIs](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)

- Important for grabbing data, often returned in JSON format

> - Very few packages for contacting APIs are out there for R (as compared to say python) 

> - Can do it yourself using `httr` package!  


## Steps to obtain data 

- Install packages needed for contacting APIs and handling data  

    + `httr` and `jsonlite`  
    
- (Usually) Obtain a key by registering at the API you want to contact  

- Construct a **URL** to obtain data (using `GET()`)

- Process data using `jsonlite` functions  


## Example https://newsapi.org/ 

Registered for a key at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/). An API for looking at news articles  

- Look at documentation for API (most have this!)  

- Example URL to obtain data is given  

`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=bitcoin&apiKey=myKeyGoesHere`


## Example https://newsapi.org/ 

- Can add in date for instance:

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dates.PNG")
```

`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=bitcoin&from=2023-05-01&apiKey=myKeyGoesHere`


## Using R to Obtain the Data

- Use `GET` from `httr` package (make sure to load package!)  

- Modify for what you have interest in!  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(httr)
GET("http://newsapi.org/v2/everything?qlnTitle=Carolina&from=2023-05-01&language=en&
    apiKey=myKeyGoesHere")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(httr)
myData <- GET("http://newsapi.org/v2/everything?qInTitle=Carolina&from=2023-05-01&language=en&pageSize=100&apiKey=aa4b545bfbd64d4bb22ba0cb9f78189c")
```

## Returned data 

- Usually what you want is stored in something like `content`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
str(myData, max.level = 1)
```

## Parse with `jsonlite`

Common steps:

- Grab the list element we want  
- Convert it to characters with `rawToChar()` 
- Convert it to a data frame (or list) with `fromJSON` from the `jsonlite` package  

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
parsed <- myData$content %>% rawToChar() %>% jsonlite::fromJSON()
str(parsed, max.level = 1)
```

## Inspecting article info

```{r, echo = TRUE}
parsed$articles %>% 
  select(title, description, source, author, everything()) %>%
  head()
```
