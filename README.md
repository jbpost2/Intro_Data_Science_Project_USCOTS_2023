# Introductory data science course project: retrieving data from an API and conducting an EDA

Creating meaningful projects in a data science course can be a time consuming task. The purpose of this beyond session is to provide example project instructions from a graduate level introductory data science course using the tidyverse that could be used to create a similar assessment for your class along with example student submissions. The purpose of the project is to give students practice writing coherent R functions to query an API (think online database), return the data in a usable format, and summarize the data in a meaningful way. The project discussed here requires the topics of: R Markdown, Function Writing, Data Manipulation, and Summarizing Data. Students should be familiar with the common steps of conducting an exploratory data analysis in R.
